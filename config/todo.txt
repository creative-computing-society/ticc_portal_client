okay now I have made the django app and the docker-compose file. I want to deploy it on my google cloud instance with domain name ticcapi.servatom.com. How do I do that now?
Booking:
    1) creating new booking:
        check if the student has already booked a slot for that day, if yes, raise error
        if AvailableSlots.isAvailable:
            if AvailableSlots.capacity - AvailableSlots.slots_booked>=1
                book the slot
                increase slots_booked by 1
            else:
                raise error
        else:
            raise error
    2) cancel booking:
        if not is_active:
            raise error that booking is already cancelled
        decrease slots_booked by 1
        #see, if it was a holiday, so booking would automatically be Cancelled
        cancel the booking, update status of booking as cancelled by student or cancelled by counsellor
        if AvailableSlots.capacity - AvailableSlots.slots_booked>=1
            make the slot available



Leave:    
    1)  Adding new leave:
        check if the counsellor who is adding their leave, already doesn't have a leave in the period. If yes, raise error
        if the leave date is in the past, raise error
        if capacity = 2:
            send the people who currently have booking of that slot an email that their booking has been cancelled
            mark those bookings as is_active=False, update remark = 'Counsellor on leave'
            mark the slot as isAvailable=False
            reduce capacity to 0

        if capacity = 4:
            if slots_booked = 3:
                check the last booking corresponding to that slot, and send email to that student
                mark that booking is_active=False, remark = 'Counsellor on leave'

            if slots_booked = 4:
                check the last two bookings corresponding to that slot, and send email to those students
                mark those bookings as is_active=False, update remark = 'Counsellor on leave'
            reduce capacity to 2


    2)  leave is deleted:
        check if the slot date is not in a holiday or the slot date is not in the past
            mark the slot as isAvailable=True
            increase capacity to 2
            fetch students for whom booking was cancelled for that slot, their remark will be 'Counsellor on leave'
            send them an email that the counsellor is back from leave, and they can book the slot again if they want to


















    1) check if slots_booked >= 3
        if slots_booked = 3:
            check the last booking corresponding to that slot, and send email to that student
            mark that booking is_active=True, remark = 'Pending'


        if slots_booked = 4:
            check the last two bookings corresponding to that slot, and send email to those students
            mark those bookings as is_active=True, update remark = 'Pending'

    2) check if slots_booked < 3
        if slots_booked = 2:
            check the last booking corresponding to that slot, and send email to that student
            mark that booking is_active=True
        if slots_booked =1:
            check the last two bookings corresponding to that slot, and send email to those students
            mark those bookings as is_active=True
